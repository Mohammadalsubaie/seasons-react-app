only usable with class componetns
You will confuse props with state :(
'State' is a JS object that contains data revelent to a componetns
Updating 'State' on a componetns causes the componetns to (almost) instantly rerender 
STATE MUST BE INITIALIZED WHEN  A componetns IS CREATED
State can be only be updated using the function 'setState'



//Note: In JavaScript, it gets all blurry and fuzzy , but it also gets easier. In JavaScript "Classes"
are just a kind of JavaScript code, a collection of properties and methods strung together as a single object,
used to create "Instances" , which are also just object. there is a "new" keyword in the languge
and it works to create Instances, but unlike c++ or other languages which actually reflect how computers really 
work, the "new" keyword just invokes an ordinary function as if it's purposw was to create an instance.
same function code you might use for a regular method, different pattern, different result. But the 
distinction is minor, because the result is just an object (always a "reference", not a "Pointer to actual memory")
and its lifecycle is not different from any othe object
//Note: SetState is a function that can puts in our app componetns automatic when we extend it react.component
